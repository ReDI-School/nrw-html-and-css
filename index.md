# HTML&CSS

Welcome to the homepage of the HTML & CSS course of Berlin at [ReDI School](https://www.redi-school.org).

On this site we collect all the materials like slides, exercises with solutions, ideas for projects
as well as additional resources that you may/should look into.

In this course we will learn how websites are made and teach you how to build your own.
