# Introduction to HTML

## _Class Agenda_

1. Introduction to web browsers
1. Introduction to HTML
1. Exercise: creating a list of website elements

## 1. Introduction to web browsers

Web browsers like Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Edge are how we use the internet.

Every time we visit a page like [https://google.com](https://google.com) or [https://redi-school.github.io/berlin-html-and-css/](https://redi-school.github.io/berlin-html-and-css/), the page we see in our browser is _structured_ using HTML and _styled_ using CSS.

Since 1993 it was decided that the Web should act as an open standard accessible worldwide.

How did the first website look like? [http://info.cern.ch/](http://info.cern.ch/)

ETA: ~15min

## 2. Introduction to HTML

This section covers the introduction to HTML and should give understanding of basic questions such as:

- What is HTML?
- What does HTML stand for?
- Why do we need HTML?
- What HTML is limited to?
- What do HTML rules and language look like?

ETA: ~40min

This section will also cover how to start working with HTML:
- How does HTML work?
- Basic elements of HTML


Moreover, this section mentions basic HTML characteristics. HTML is an `easy-to-use` `markup language` that is `platform independent` and can be integrated with other web languages such as `CSS` and `JavaScript`.

A good linker between sections 1. and 2. is the question `What cannot be done by HTML`?

ETA: ~20min

Break: ~5min

## Exercise: website analysis

All websites have structure - but we often don't think about it! Common website features:

- Navigation bar or nav bar
- Search bar
- Tabs
- Blocks with image + text together (like an item and its name on an online shopping page, or an article headline and image on a news site)

An example of HTML with this structure is [Mozilla Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) or [Redi School website](https://www.redi-school.org/)

ETA: ~10min
### Working in groups: inspect HTML and list basic elements
1. By working in groups or individually, visit any website (e.g. [Mozilla Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) or [Redi School website](https://www.redi-school.org/)) and inspect what elements the web page consist of.
1. Create a file in Codepen and write down what elements web page consist of in HTML [unordered list <ul>](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_ul.asp) tags.
1. Pay attention to patterns - what is similar with the sites you visit? What is different?

ETA: ~30min
# Glossary & Terminology

- `Browser compatibility` - Browser compatibility is the ability of a certain website to work on different browser types and versions. In other words, when asking the following question, for example: "_Is this CSS rule compatible with Internet Explorer 9?_" we want to know whether the CSS rule will work on the Internet Explorer 9 browser
- `Cascading` - The term _"cascading"_ in the context of CSS describes the process of combining several style sheets and resolving conflicts between them.
- `CSS` - Cascading Style Sheets is a language for styling web pages.
- `Programming language` - A Programming language is language to create a certain software program. Any software program is followed by certain instructions, for instance- receive input data and compute some output.
- `JavaScript` is the programming language of the Web to create a dynamic web applications.
- `Dynamic web page` - A dynamic page is a web page that can change its content and display it dynamically based on conditional rules. 
- `Static web page` - is a web page created with HTML language with a purpose to present structured data on web. A static web page always remains the same based on its structure.
- `HTML` - is a markup language for creating web pages. Word HTML is an acronym for Hyper Text Markup Language.
- `Markup language` - A Markup language is a simple human-readable language which is used to make the so-called "notes" to the computer program (e.g. the browser)
- `Hyper Text` - Hyper text is a special text that just forms a link, that allows a user to click on it and get redirected to a new page referenced by that link.
- `Specification` - A specification is a collection of rules and requirements that form a certain technical standard. For example, W3C maintains the specification of HTML. In other words, W3C defines how HTML looks like and what its rules are.
- `W3C` - W3C stands for World Wide Web Consortium, which is the main international standards organization for the World Wide Web. It maintains HTML and CSS specification (i.e. rules)
- `W3Schools` - W3Schools is another useful website which provides documentation for HTML and CSS
- `MDN` Web Docs - MDN stands for Mozilla Developer Network. The MDN Web Docs is a website which provides information and documentation about Open Web technologies such as HTML and CSS.

# Homework

1. For next session please create a [HTML table](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Tables/Basics) from the list elements created during the class. The table should contain the list of HTML elements of the analyzed web page.
2. Make yourself familiar with the [MDN Web Docs website](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) and with the [W3Schools website](https://www.w3schools.com/) as they are good source of documentation

# Resources
